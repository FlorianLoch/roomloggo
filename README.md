# Roomloggo

Small service that read temperature and humidity information from the `dnt RoomLogg Pro/ELV Raumklimastation RS 500`
via USB in order to feed it into an InfluxDB afterwards.

The implementation has been inspired by/is based on [roomlogg-go](https://github.com/jhendess/roomlogg-go) and the research
done for the [Raumklima project](https://github.com/juergen-rocks/raumklima).
